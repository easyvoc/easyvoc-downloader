# âš  Error handling

There are two types of errors:

* Visible errors

### Visible errors

A visible error is an error where you can clearly see the problem.&#x20;

For example:

* Spelling mistakes
* Things happening unexpectedly.

#### Spelling mistakes

If you see a spelling mistake, follow these steps:

1. Take a clear screenshot of the problem
2. Go to the Discord server
3. Upload the image

#### Things happening unexpectedly&#x20;

When things happen unexpectedly, follow these steps:

1. Take a clear screenshot of the problem
2. Go to the Discord server
3. Upload the image and describe what is happening.

### Invisible errors

Invisible errors are errors that you can't see. These types of errors are most of the times in the code.

An invisible error expresses itself by immediate closing the app.

If this happens follow these steps:

1. Take a clear screenshot of the problem
2. Go to the Discord server
3. Upload the image and describe what is happening.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before you go to the Discord server, always check these things:

* You did not change the name of any file
* The files are all in the same folder.
{% endhint %}
